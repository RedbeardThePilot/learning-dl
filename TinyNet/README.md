# deepnet

Implementations of CNNs, RNNs and cool new techniques in deep learning

Note: deepnet is a work in progress and things will be added gradually. It is not intended for production, use it to learn and study implementations of latest and greatest in deep learning.

1. Convolutional net
2. Feed forward net
3. Recurrent net

**Optimization Algorithms**
1. SGD
2. SGD with momentum
3. Nesterov Accelerated Gradient
4. Adagrad
5. RMSprop
6. Adam

**Regularization**
1. Dropout
2. L1 and L2 Regularization

**Cool Techniques**

1. BatchNorm
2. Xavier Weight Initialization

**Nonlinearities**
